# 📌 SQL Task 6 – Subqueries in Hotel Booking System

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and apply different types of **subqueries** in MySQL to retrieve, compare, and filter data efficiently in a **Hotel Booking System** database.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **MySQL 8.x** – Database Management System
* **MySQL Workbench** – Query design, execution, and testing
* **SQL** – Subquery syntax and operations

---

## 📁 Task Activities

1. **Scalar Subqueries** – Used for single-value lookups (e.g., total payments for a guest).
2. **Correlated Subqueries** – Created per-row dependent queries (e.g., latest booking date per guest).
3. **Subqueries in WHERE** – Applied `IN`, `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, `ANY`, and `ALL` to filter data.
4. Practiced real-world scenarios in the **Hotel Booking System** (`guests`, `rooms`, `bookings`, `payments`, `services_used`).

---

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

* Learned how to implement **scalar**, **correlated**, and **multi-row subqueries**.
* Understood how `IN`, `EXISTS`, `ANY`, `ALL` affect query logic and performance.
* Gained skills in combining subqueries with joins for complex reporting.
